# blog-src [![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/wei2912/blog-src.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/wei2912/blog-src)

This is the source of my personal blog, [weien.io](https://weien.io), and is
where I keep my articles as well as the code of my static site generator, which
is based upon [Hakyll](https://jaspervdj.be/hakyll/).

# Installation

To build the source, you need [Stack](https://www.haskellstack.org/). The whole
source is in Haskell and the package can be easily and reproducibly built with
Stack.

```bash
stack setup # if you need to set up a GHC environment that is separate from your system
stack build
```

# Running

You can use the executable file generated by Stack to perform a wide variety of
tasks. For more information, run this command:

```bash
stack exec blog-src -h
```

To build the `.sass` files, you will need to install the [Sass executable](https://sass-lang.com/install).
