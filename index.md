## Design of Blog

The design of this blog was intended to be minimalist, while being very readable and following responsive design principles. The general look and feel of the blog is inspired by <a href="https://bost.ocks.org/mike">Mike Bostock</a>'s website.

The content of the blog is generated by [Hakyll](https://jaspervdj.be/hakyll), a static site generator written in Haskell which allows for great flexibility in the rendering of pages. The math equations are written in $\LaTeX$ and rendered by [MathJax](https://www.mathjax.org).

The source of the website is available on [GitHub](https://github.com/wei2912) at [blog-src](https://github.com/wei2912/blog-src). The generated blog can be viewed at [blog](https://github.com/wei2912/blog) and is built by [Travis CI](https://travis-ci.org) on each commit to the source repository.
