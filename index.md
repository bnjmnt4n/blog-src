## Design of Blog

The design of this blog was intended to be minimalist, while being very
readable and following responsive design principles. The general look and feel
of the blog is inspired by [Mike Bostock](https://bost.ocks.org/mike)'s
website.

My website is hosted on [DigitalOcean](https://www.digitalocean.com). I used
these software to build the website:

* [Hakyll](https://jaspervdj.be/hakyll), a static site generator written in
Haskell which allows for great flexibility in the building of pages,
* [KaTeX](https://katex.org) for [LaTeX](https://www.latex-project.org/) math
equations

I also run the following services on my server:

* [Matomo](https://matomo.org) which provides free web analytics that respects
user privacy
* [Commento](https://commento.io) which provides the commenting platform on
the posts

In addition to the above, I use these external services:

* [Cloudflare](https://www.cloudflare.com) serves DNS requests as well as all
of the content for [weien.io](https://weien.io)
* [Mailgun](https://www.mailgun.com/) for notification emails
* [Askimet](https://akismet.com) for comments spam protection
