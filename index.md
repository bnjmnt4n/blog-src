## Design of Blog

The design of this blog was intended to be minimalist, while being very
readable and following responsive design principles. The general look and feel
of the blog is inspired by [Mike Bostock](https://bost.ocks.org/mike)'s
website.

The content of the blog is generated by [Hakyll](https://jaspervdj.be/hakyll),
a static site generator written in Haskell which allows for great flexibility
in the rendering of pages.

The math equations are written in [LaTeX](https://www.latex-project.org/) and
rendered by [KaTeX](https://katex.org/). The commenting system is
[Talkyard](https://www.talkyard.io/) which uses various ideas from
[Discourse](https://www.discourse.org/) and allows a fair bit of flexibility in
the way comments are hosted.

The source of the website is available on [GitHub](https://github.com/wei2912)
at [blog-src](https://github.com/wei2912/blog-src). The generated blog can be
viewed at [blog](https://github.com/wei2912/blog) and is built by
[Travis CI](https://travis-ci.org) on each commit to the source repository.
