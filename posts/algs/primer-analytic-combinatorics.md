While the terms of every sequence is countable, it is possible to represent sequences using techniques involving real or complex numbers which are uncountably infinite in nature, however counter-intuitive that may seem. A sequence such as the following:

$$1, 1, 1, \ldots$$

can be represented into a polynomial
